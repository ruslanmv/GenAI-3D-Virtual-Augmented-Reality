# Generative AI in 3D Virtual Reality

Hello everyone! In this repository, we are going to build a fascinating demo application that allows us to create 360-degree 3D environments using Generative AI. Imagine having the power to request an environment like, "Let me feel like I am at the beach," and the AI engine generates a 3D environment based on your prompt.

You can use your phone or VR headset to experience the created 3D environment. Additionally, the program can analyze engineering projects and generate 3D prototypes. The possibilities are endless, from generating 360-degree images for immersive 3D experiences with virtual reality to using the chatbot to create prototypes of supercars, airplanes, and more!

## Getting Started

To get started, you'll need the following:

1. An IBM Cloud account.
2. Watson AI services on the IBM Cloud platform.

### Setting up the IBM Cloud and Watson AI

1. Create an account on [IBM Cloud](https://cloud.ibm.com/).
2. Set up Watson AI services by following the [official documentation](https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/watson?topic=watson-getting-started).

### Building the project

1. Clone the repository:

```
git clone https://github.ibm.com/ruslanmv/GenAI-3DVR.git
```

2. Install the required dependencies:

```
cd GenAI-3DVR
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

3. Configure your API keys and credentials for the IBM Cloud and Watson AI services in the `config.py` file.

4. Run the application:

```
python app.py
```

5. Open your browser and navigate to `http://localhost:5000` to start using the application.
