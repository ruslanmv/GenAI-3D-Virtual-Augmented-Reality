# Generative AI in 3D Virtual - Augmented Reality 

Welcome to our Generative AI in 3D Virtual Reality repository! In this project, we showcase a captivating demo application that generates immersive 360-degree 3D environments using Generative AI. By interacting with a Non-Player Character (NPC) powered by Watsonx.ai, users can request environments like, "Let me feel like I am at the beach," and the AI engine will create a 3D environment based on the given prompt.

Users can experience the generated 3D environment on their phones or VR headsets. Moreover, the program can analyze engineering projects and create 3D prototypes. The potential applications are vast, ranging from generating 360-degree images for immersive 3D experiences in virtual reality to utilizing the chatbot for creating prototypes of supercars, airplanes, and more!

The project consists of three parts:

## Creating a Smart NPC with Watsonx.ai LLM in Unreal Engine 5

The first part involves creating a Smart NPC with Watsonx.ai LLM in Unreal Engine 5.

## 3D Worlds with Diffusion Models and LoRA using WatsonX.ai

In the second part, we generate a 3D world based on the user's prompt using Watsonx.ai.
